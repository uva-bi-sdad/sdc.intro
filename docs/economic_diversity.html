Overview
</div>
<div class="section_text">
<p>Fairfax County stakeholders are interested in understanding economic
health, in particular economic diversity and minority business
ownership. Specifically, our stakeholders are interested in gaining an
overview of minority owned business activity in the County. We also
wanted to study the relationship between minority businesses ownership
and employment of minorities. To investigate this topic, we began by
discovering existing data sources related to businesses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section_header">
Data discovery
</div>
<div class="section_text">
<p>We found that <a href="https://www.mergentintellect.com">Mergent
Intellect</a>, a data source licensed by the University of Virginia
Library, contained information on business locations and minority
ownership. To use this data to align with our stakeholder’s questions,
we carefully examined available metadata and data dictionaries. A
<strong>minority owned business</strong>, as defined by the <a
href="https://in.nau.edu/contracting-purchasing-services/small-and-diverse-business-program-definitions/">U.S.
Small Business Administration (SBA)</a>, must be majority (51%) owned by
an individual or individuals belonging to minority racial or ethnic
(Hispanic) groups. Other designations by SBA, such as Women and
Veteran-owned businesses, were not within the scope of this
investigation.</p>
<p>In our process of data discovery, we found a large discrepancy
between the composition of business ownership reported in Fairfax by the
<a
href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7a670bacb15b4e67b80982e6fd6a9fba/page/Demog-Composition/">U.S.
Census Bureau Survey of Business Owners</a> and the composition reported
by Mergent Intellect. As we will discuss in next steps, we are currently
investigating methods to bridge this gap and efficiently use real-time
opportunity data to investigate minority business ownership.</p>
<p>For our investigation, we aimed to provide Fairfax County with a
descriptive overview of business activity by minority owned businesses.
To describe business activity, we collected information related to
industry and time. To understand industry activity, we extracted
industry classification data from Mergent Intellect. Mergent Intellect
provides the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code
for businesses, which is a standard for collecting and publishing data
related to the business economy. Mergent Intellect also reports the
founding year of a business, so we inferred its years of operation
between 2011-2020. Given these data, we proposed metrics to describe
industry activities that are <em>cross-sectional</em> and <em>over
time</em>.</p>

Overview of minority owned businesses

<div class="section_text">
<p>Exhibit 1 below presents data from Mergent Intellect to show the
number of businesses in Fairfax County between 2011 and 2020 by minority
and non-minority ownership.</p>
<p>Mergent Intellect data show that the number of companies in Fairfax
County has grown 112% between 2011 and 2020. The number of minority
owned companies has grown 138%. Minority owned companies represent a
small share of companies in Fairfax County. In 2011, the share of
minority owned companies represented 7% of total companies which grew to
8% in 2020 (see Exhibit 1).</p>

<p>The data from Mergent Intellect provide a general overview of
minority owned business activity in Fairfax. The number of minority
owned businesses in the county has grown relatively proportionally to
business growth overall. We also see that minority owned businesses do
not exceed more than 20% of total ownership in any industry.</p>

The relationship between minority business ownership and minority

<p>Exhibit 3 shows overall trends for employment by minority owned
businesses across all industries. We see that employment is concentrated
in industries characterized by high minority owned business
activity:</p>

<li>Administrative and support (17%)</li>
<li>Construction (6%)</li>
<li>Information (12%)</li>
<li>Transportation and warehousing (19%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The share of employment by minority owned companies in each industry
remains below 23%. For all industries with high minority owned business
activity except construction, the share of employment is above 10%.</p>

<div class="section_text">
<p>Our stakeholders were interested in understanding the relationship
between minority owned businesses and employment of minorities. The
Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamic Survey (LEHD) Origin-Destination
Employment Statistics (LODES) provides data on jobs by Census block
group broken down into racial and ethnic classifications. We were able
to combine this data with information from Mergent Intellect to
investigate the spatial relationship between minority owned businesses
and minority employment.</p>
<p>Exhibit 4 (Left) shows the percentage of minority employees by Census
block group in Fairfax County in 2019. We observe that minority
employment accounts for below 25% of total employment in most Census
block groups in Fairfax. We also see pockets with higher concentrations
of minority employment in the County. Exhibit 4 (Right) shows the
percentage of minority businesses by Census block group in Fairfax
County in 2019. We observe that minority ownership, as well, accounts
for less than 20% of total ownership in most Census block groups in
Fairfax. Again, we also see areas with higher concentrations of minority
business ownership in the County.</p>

<p>Exhibit 5 shows the relationship between between the percentage of
minority owned businesses and the percentage of minority workers in
Census block groups in Fairfax County in 2019. We see no correlation in
the presence of minority owned businesses and the presence of minority
employees. We were surprised by this finding, as we were expecting to
find a positive relationship between these variables. A spatial
correlation between minority business ownership and minority employment
can be mostly explained by a higher concentration of businesses overall.
In other words, more minority businesses operate in Census block groups
with high business activity in general, and therefore higher employment
overall, including minority employment.</p>

Next Steps
</div>
</div>
<div class="section_text">
<p>This analysis provides an early view of minority business ownership.
We are continuing to collaborate with our stakeholders in Fairfax County
to investigate the topic of minority business ownership. The next steps
in our analysis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to validate our results using U.S. Census Bureau Survey
of Business Owners.</li>
<li>Leveraging real-time opportunity data and modeling techniques to
measure minority business ownership more accurately.</li>
<li>Completing case studies to understand the business ownership and
employment dynamics of specific industries or business corridor.</li>
<li>Creating more metrics for studying this topic, including the exit
and entry rate of businesses, as well as the creation and destruction of
jobs.</li>
