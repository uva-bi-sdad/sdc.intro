### We use our **Community Learning Through Data Driven Discovery (CLD3)** framework to drive the construction of the Social Impact Data Commons. Our initial grounding in **specific, local issues** is developed in partnership with community stakeholders in Arlington and Fairfax Counties in Virginia.

### Our initial local issues included

* equity of access to broadband communications
* equity and stability of access to staple foods
* transforming racial equity data into meaningful geographies

### Data collection

After grounding in local issues, we collected data from a variety of sources to create novel measures and datasets. These datasets feed into our applications, including our API and dashboard.

A Data Commons allows multiple audiences to explore issues relevant to their communities.

 (in geographies they want, measuring what they want).
