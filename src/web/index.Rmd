title: "What is a Data Commons?"
---

### A Data Commons is an open knowledge repository that **co-locates** data from a variety of sources, builds and **curates data insights**, and provides tools designed to track issues over time and geography allowing governments and key stakeholders to learn continuously from their own data. \n

### Project motivation

By creating below county-level datasets and measures derived from publicly collectable data sources, we provide actionable data for local government. We aim to inform equitable and sustainable growth in Virginia and the National Capital Region.
