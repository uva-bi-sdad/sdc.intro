### What is a data commons?

A Data Commons is an open knowledge repository that ***co-locates** data from a variety of sources, builds and **curates data insights**, and provides tools designed to track issues over time and geography allowing governments and key stakeholders to learn continuously from their own data. \n

For example, our data commons:

* Provides data, indicators, indices, case studies, and training
* Analyzes impact from social, economic, and health trends and major events 
* Enables ongoing learning from data
* Addresses issues of concern, for example, food insecurity, equity, lack of affordable housing

A Data Commons allows multiple audiences to explore issues relevant to their communities.
