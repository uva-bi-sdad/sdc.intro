## Supporting local equity-informed decision-making in the National Capital Region

#### By creating new below county-level datasets and measures derived from publicly collectible data sources, we provide actionable data for local-level decision-making. We aim to inform equitable and sustainable growth in Virginia and the National Capital Region.

### What is a Data Commons?

#### A Data Commons is an open knowledge repository that **co-locates** data from a variety of sources, builds and **curates data insights**, and provides tools designed to track issues over time and geography. A Data Commons allows governments and key stakeholders to learn continuously from their own data. \n
