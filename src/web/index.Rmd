    <h3>What is a Data Commons?</h3>
    <h4>A Data Commons is an open knowledge repository that **co-locates** data from a variety of sources, builds and **curates data insights**, and provides tools designed to track issues over time and geography. A Data Commons allows governments and key stakeholders to learn continuously from their own data.</h4>
