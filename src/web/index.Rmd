    <h4>What is a Data Commons?</h4>

A Data Commons is an open knowledge repository that **co-locates** data from a variety of sources, builds and **curates data insights**, and provides tools designed to track issues over time and geography. A Data Commons allows governments and key stakeholders to learn continuously from their own data.
