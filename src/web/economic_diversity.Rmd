### Issue overview

Our Arlington and Fairfax County stakeholders were interested in diving deeply into measures of economic health, specifically economic diversity in their counties. We began by analyzing the diversity of business ownership in the counties, collecting data from [Mergent Intellect](https://www.mergentintellect.com/index.php/search/index). To create policy-actionable metrics, we transformed data into relevant local geographies for decisionmaking, including business corridors.
